## The Solid principles

The Solid principles are a set of guidelines for developers to write scalable and maintainable code, introduced by Robert C. Martin in the early 2000s.

Here Solid is an acronym for:
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen-Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

We will look into these one by one, first some text about the principle followed by the example code. I will try to provide good and bad code example.
Please find listing of each principle below.
